# Exercise 1
## Shape
You could create interfaces for area, perimeter, distance, and getClosestPoint. You could then extend this principle by making classes for each shape which implements the interfaces.

Open/Closed principle is upheld, but not in a great way.

Liskov principle can not be applied because rectangle contains more methods and fields.

Interface segrecation principle is not upheld as it implements methods that are not applicable to all shapes.

Dependency inversion principle.. no!

## Rectangle
    

## Circle
